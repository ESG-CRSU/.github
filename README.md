# Evidence Synthesis Group @ CRSU
We are an evidence synthesis group of researchers and experts funded by the [National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR)](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/) capable of delivering the best standard of evidence through identifying, evaluating and combining data from existing research. The group - one of nine NIHR-funded evidence synthesis groups - is focused primarily on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of treatments, tests and other interventions in order to support decision-making across the health, public health and social care sectors within the UK.

The group is a collaboration between [Cochrane](https://www.cochrane.org/) and the Universities of [Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/), [Leicester](https://le.ac.uk/) and [York](https://www.york.ac.uk/) and is led by Glasgow's [Professor Olivia Wu](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/healthwellbeing/staff/oliviawu/), Co-Director of the [Health Economics and Health Technology Assessment (HEHTA) research group](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/healthwellbeing/research/hehta/).  

This GitHub page is where we hold our data extraction and analysis files of our commissions projects so that we follow the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).
